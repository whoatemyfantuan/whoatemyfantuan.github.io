I will put all my Math Notes here! Feel free to take it if you are interested!!

Why do this?
------
Why I am doing this when there are so many great books in a wide range of mathematics? Indeed, I am just a lover, and my notes may not have great value. [Dexter Chua's Note](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/) will definitely be more useful and clearer than mine. However, I just think this work is fun and beneficial for integrating my knowledge. Just for fun, no other reasons.
