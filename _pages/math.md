I will put all my reading and scribe notes here. Feel free to take it if you are interested. The reason that I am writing these notes is, I am INTP, which means that I am extremely uncomfortable if my knowledge is not integrated somewhere somehow besides in my mind. Sometimes there are steps missing in the books, important theorems not proved, various messy literature everywhere in my laptop disks, and those will also make me feel uncomfortable.
