I will put all my Math Notes here! Feel free to take it if you are interested!!

Why do this?
------
Why I am doing this when there are so many great books in a wide range of mathematics? Indeed, I am just a lover, and my notes may not have great value. [Dexter Chua's Note](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/) will definitely be more useful and clearer than mine. However, I have my own habit when writing my own note manually, and I am very sure that everybody has their unique habit. It is more clear when transforming my hand-written notes into LaTeX files, while preserving my habit (e.g., I love theorems in red, proofs in grey and definitions in blue, and I like to draw a frame to emphasize them). That would definitely be a treasure for myself, and if luckily, can be a treasure for somebody else. The second reason is that, some books in mathematics are classic but very old, e.g., P.Halmos' Measure Theory and John Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds. The old printing style makes them difficult to read. I personally, prefer to go through my own notes for review after reading the books.
