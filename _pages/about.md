Hi! My name is Jingxuan Xu. You can call me fantuan (the Chinese translation of 'Kimbap') either. I was studying [Applied Mathematics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/applied-mathematics) at [Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). Now I am a [Biostatistics](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/department-research/biostatistics/) student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/).

I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Prof. Steven Ma](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/shuangge-ma/) in School of Public Health, Yale University. I am also currently co-advised by [Dr. Zhenqiu Lin](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/zhenqiu-lin/) from [Yale Center for Outcome Research and Evaluation (CORE)](https://medicine.yale.edu/core/) and [Dr. Hao Mei](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/jxtd/jsdw/swtjylxbxx/f19457567e31409488f1396d3538a2a0.htm) from Renmin University of China, on a project about human disease correlation network analysis.
