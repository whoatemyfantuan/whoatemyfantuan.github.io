Hi! My name is Jingxuan Xu. You can call me fantuan (the Chinese translation of 'Kimbap') either. I was studying [Applied Mathematics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/applied-mathematics) at [Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). Now I am a [Biostatistics](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/department-research/biostatistics/) student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/).

I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Prof. Steven Ma](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/shuangge-ma/) in School of Public Health, Yale University. I am also currently co-advised by [Dr. Zhenqiu Lin](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/zhenqiu-lin/) from [Yale Center for Outcome Research and Evaluation (CORE)](https://medicine.yale.edu/core/) and [Dr. Hao Mei](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/jxtd/jsdw/swtjylxbxx/f19457567e31409488f1396d3538a2a0.htm) from Renmin University of China, on a project about methodologies of WGCNA with application on human disease correlation network analysis.

Personal Interests
======
I am a huge pure math fan! I am willing to discuss any fun facts in pure mathematics. My main interest is in the field of analysis, especially in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. I decide to study more about stochastic differential equations and operator theory in the future.

I am also a huge rock music fan! My fanvourite band is Pink Floyd. I started my own band during my first year in high school (that is really many years ago!). After going into university, I started to write my own songs. There are many great post-punk and art rock pieces completed. Unfortunately, they are not recorded and made public.

Contents of this website
======
Since I am now a student, I have not much contents placed on this website. However, I will ocassionally update my own math notes written in LaTeX and made it public! Feel free to take it if you think my notes is in good format and you are interested in learning some stuff from pure mathematics.
