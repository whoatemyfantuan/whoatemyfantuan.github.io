Hi! My name is Jingxuan Xu. You can call me fantuan (the Chinese translation of 'Kimbap') either. I was studying [Mathematics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/applied-mathematics) at [Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) from 2019 to 2021 and [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) from 2021 to 2023. Now I am a [Biostatistics](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/department-research/biostatistics/) student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/).

I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Prof. Steven Ma](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/shuangge-ma/) in School of Public Health, Yale University. I am also currently co-advised by [Dr. Zhenqiu Lin](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/zhenqiu-lin/) from [Yale Center for Outcome Research and Evaluation (CORE)](https://medicine.yale.edu/core/) and [Dr. Hao Mei](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/jxtd/jsdw/swtjylxbxx/f19457567e31409488f1396d3538a2a0.htm) from Renmin University of China, on a project about analysis of structural temporal variation in marginal human disease clinical treatment network among the elderly.

Personal Interests
======
My current research interest is on theory and methodologies of survival analysis, network analysis, high-dimensional statistics and non/semi-parametric methods. I am currently working on a network analysis project, which aims to analzye the temporal variation of connectivity structure in humen disease network constructed among the elderly. The strategy is to construct a marginal network so that we can decompose, smooth and model the temporal trend node-wise. I am also currently working on a survival analysis project, which aims to use target emulation trial and deep learning methods to compare the survival outcome of single/dual chamber Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD), and see through the causal relations between covariates and the outcome. The network project would be submitted as my master thesis.

I am a huge rock music fan! My favourite genres are progressive rock/metal, psychedelic rock, post-punk and math rock. My fanvourite bands are Pink Floyd, Dream Theater, Guckkasten, Hiperson etc. I started my own band during my first year in high school (that is really many years ago). After going into university, I started to write my own songs. There are many great post-punk and art rock pieces completed. Unfortunately, they are not recorded and made public. Now I am more focused on research and academic, but I will still try writing songs and playing bands when I have time and energy to spare.

I am a math lover. I am especially interested in stochastic analysis, harmonic/wavelet analysis and applications in PDE. I am a 'lover' because I am really in any ways not professional on it, and I don't do any research on these topics. Currently preparing to delve more into algebra and geometry, but, again, if I have time and energy to spare.

Contents of this website
======
Since I am now a student, I have not much contents placed on this website. However, I will ocassionally update my own math notes written in LaTeX and made it public! Feel free to take it if you think my notes is in good format and you are interested in learning some stuff listed there.
